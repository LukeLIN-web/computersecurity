## Report

I pledge, on my honor as a student, that I really watched the movie in its entirety, within the time period prior to the assignment being due.

1. When a computer freezes, one generally doesn't press the delete key. - **Changing** it to the enter key would be more accurate. Or 'ls', which are the keys a programmer would subconsciously press when stuck. 'ls' might not be understood by the general audience, so changing it to the enter key is better.
2. Infiltrating a financial system is not an easy task. In reality, city infrastructure systems have high levels of redundancy and security measures. To completely control or paralyze a major city's traffic and financial systems, one would need to overcome extremely complex technical obstacles, which is nearly impossible. - This can't be changed; it's the setting.
3. It's not possible for them to monitor all radio signals and instantly recognize keywords through voice recognition to find the protagonist. - This can't be changed; it's the setting.
4. At 57 minutes, it's impossible for the entire East Coast's power to be shut down by a single switch. This goes against safety principles. The destruction of power plants and the release of gas: In the real world, power plants have strict safety measures, including physical security. Remotely releasing gas or causing large-scale destruction is highly unrealistic. - This can't be changed; it's the setting.
5. At one hour and thirteen minutes, in the power center of the East, there is a closed-circuit computer. On this closed-circuit computer, the protagonist should not be able to directly reverse-hack the enemy's computer or implant advertisements. Moreover, implanting advertisements is not that quick. - To make it more reasonable, it should be done using the **protagonist's own computer**, which he has already prepared with various cyber bomb invasion software.
6. When making a phone call, one can't just press a button to start tracking a remote connection, or even directly reverse-call a camera. - This can't be changed; it's the setting.
7. The character known as the 'Mage', who is a tech master, is unlikely to be easily found by his IP address after hacking in. In reality, highly skilled hackers often use various anonymity techniques and complex networks to hide their identity and location, making them hard to quickly track and locate. - This can't be changed; it's the setting.
8. At 1 hour and 52 minutes, hacking into a fighter jet is shown, but forging a voice is not that quick. The pilot should be able to recognize that the voice of the command center has changed.  - - This can't be changed; it's the setting.
